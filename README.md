# Custom-Metronome

<b>Project Inspiration</b>

This projects was inspired through me learning to play the piano. Whenver I would play, I would never have multiple ways
of visualizing the metronomne beat. I either had to use the metronomoe built into the piano or use my laptop. The goal of 
this project was to see if I could create a metronome from scratch with custom features.

<b>Project Materials:</b>

  1. ATmega32 AVR microcontroller 
  2. Magnetic Speakers
  3. 9V Power Supply
  4. Bread Board
  5. Jumper Wires
  6. Regulator
  7. ISP Connector
  8. Keypad
  9. LCD
  10. 2 .1uF capacitor
  11. 3-4 .1 kiloohm resistors

<b>Features:</b>
  1. User can control the tempo of the metronome (defaults to 75bpm)
  2. Metronome beat is visualized through 4 LEDS which corresponds to the time signature (only 4/4 time signature is implemnted)
  3. Metronome beat is visualized thorugh LCD screen with dashes
  4. User can edit settings to turn on/off the LED or LCD visualization
